In this article I want to share my search for understanding what `Meta-programming` means and why I see it as a necessity for creating [Meta](/about/ "Computer that learns, thinks, decides, and acts").

My initial approach in searching was to use `Meta-programming` as the keyword. These gave me the following defintions:

> Meta-programs are programs that manipulate other program. - - <cite>Martin Berger and Laurence Tratt; [Program Logics for Homogenous Meta-Programming](http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~mfb21/publications/lpar10/lpar10.pdf)</cite>

> Meta-programming is the generation or manipulation of programs, or parts of programs, by other programs, i.e. in an algorithmic way. - - <cite>Tim Sheard; [Accomplishments and research challenges in Meta-Programming](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~melsheik/thesis/thesis/node29.html)

> Metaprogramming is the act of writing code that operates on code rather than on data. This involves inspecting and modifying a program as it runs using constructs exposed by the language. - - <cite>[Rubymonk](https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/2-metaprogramming-ruby/chapters/32-introduction-to-metaprogramming/lessons/75-being-meta)</cite>

With these first definitions that I got, what I gather is that `Meta-Programming` is an approach that allows me to create an application that will manipulate not just data but also code. If this is anything like the typical data manipulation, then this means for me that I should be able to create, read, update, and delete programns (CRUD). W

> Metaprogramming refers to a variety of ways a program has knowledge of itself or can manipulate itself.

> Metaprogramming is the writing of computer programs with the ability to treat programs as their data. It means that a program could be designed to read, generate, analyse or transform other programs, and even modify itself while running.
