Ever since I've been exposed to communicating with computers, I've been amazed at its possibilities. I've always thought that it would be great if the computer could learn, think, decide, and act on its own. Recently, I discovered the concept of meta-programming (insert link to blog article). Upon reading it, I thought to myself that this is what I'll need to create "Meta", my computer that can learn, think, decide, and act.

This is my blog for documenting my quest in mastering meta-programming using [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). My intention is to force myself to express how I understand things. I welcome any feedback, comments, suggestions, and/or constructive criticisms.

Welcome to my journey.
